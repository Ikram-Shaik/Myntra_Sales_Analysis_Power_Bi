# Myntra_Sales_Analysis_Power_Bi

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing sales data from Myntra using Google Sheets and Power BI to gain insights into key sales metrics. The analysis helps in understanding sales trends, profit distribution, and product performance.

## Objectives
- Download the provided Myntra sales dataset.
- Perform necessary data cleaning and preprocessing steps to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Explore and analyze the dataset to extract insights.
- Create visualizations for key metrics like profit, quantity, and sales amount.

## Dataset
The dataset includes fields such as:
- `Order ID`
- `Order Date`
- `CustomerName`
- `State`
- `City`
- `Amount`
- `Profit`
- `Quantity`
- `Category`
- `Sub-Category`
- `PaymentMode`
  

## Features
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing** (Google Sheets)
   - Handled missing values and duplicates.
   - Standardized data formats for analysis (e.g., date formats, numerical data).
   - Prepared the data for seamless integration into Power BI.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** (Google Sheets & Power BI)
   - Summarized key metrics such as total quantity, profit, and sales amount.
   - Analyzed sales data across categories, payment modes, and months.

3. **Visualizations** (Power BI)
   - **Cards for Key Metrics**:
     - **Total Quantity**
     - **Total Profit**
     - **Total Sales Amount**
   
   - **Charts**:
     - **Sum of Profit by Category**: A breakdown of profit for each product category.
     - **Sum of Quantity by Payment Mode**: Total quantity sold based on payment methods.
     - **Sum of Profit by Month**: Profit trends over time (monthly).
     - **Sum of Profit by Category**: Comparison of profits across different categories.

## Tools Used
- **Google Sheets**: For data cleaning, preprocessing, and basic exploration.
- **Power BI**: For advanced data visualization and dashboard creation.

## How to Run the Project
1. **Download the Dataset**: Start by downloading the provided Myntra sales dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Use Google Sheets to clean and preprocess the data (handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting).
3. **Data Exploration**: Analyze the dataset in Google Sheets for preliminary insights.
4. **Visualization**: Import the cleaned data into Power BI to create dashboards and charts.

## Insights Gained
- Identified the most profitable product categories.
- Found popular payment modes based on sales quantity.
- Tracked profit variations over months to uncover trends.
- Analyzed overall sales performance in terms of quantity, profit, and amount.

## Future Enhancements
- Further analysis by product subcategories or seasonal trends.
- Integration with external datasets to enrich insights (e.g., customer demographics).

## Conclusion
The Myntra Sales Analysis project provides a comprehensive view of sales performance, offering actionable insights into profitability, quantity sold, and payment trends using Google Sheets for preprocessing and Power BI for visualization.
